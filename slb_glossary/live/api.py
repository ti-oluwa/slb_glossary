    Load `url` and wait until the results panel differs from the given baseline.

    The glossary is a mostly single-page application. Navigating between search
    filters changes only the URL fragment, so a fresh `page.goto` can
    resolve before the site's JavaScript has actually re-rendered the
    results panel. This polls the rendered result links and results header
    until at least one of them differs from the caller's baseline, or
    until `session.settle_timeout` elapses. Whichever comes first.

        always something real to diff against. An empty sequence here
        means "nothing rendered yet", which skips the wait entirely and
        risks reading a stale, pre-filter panel.
    :param previous_header: Results header text rendered before this
        navigation. This is a second, independent signal that the panel actually
        updated, so a coincidental match on `previous_links` alone (e.g.
