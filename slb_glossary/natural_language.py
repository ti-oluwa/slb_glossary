Recognized phrasings. Each is matched whole-string (not just a prefix),

mean", "explain and give an example") isn't mangled. Only a query that

    Strip a recognized natural-language wrapper off `query`, leaving just the term.

    Local and live matching both work against actual term names and
    words, not conversational phrasing. Unstripped, a query like "what is
    porosity" would be searched as the literal phrase "what is porosity",
    which typically matches nothing, since no term's name or text
    contains the word "what". Stripping first gives such a query the same
    shot at a real match that searching "porosity" directly would get.

        whitespace trimmed. Just whitespace-trimmed `query` if no wrapper
        was recognized.
