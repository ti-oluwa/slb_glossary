Environment-overridable constants for `slb_glossary`.

Every tunable constant in the package is meant to live here, as a
`Constant` descriptor on `Constants`, instead of as a bare module-level
value scattered across whichever file happens to use it first. Reach for
it through the shared `constants` instance:

```python
from slb_glossary.constants import constants

pool_size = constants.similar_terms_pool_size
```

`Constant` optionally ties a field to an environment variable, so it can
be overridden without editing code (`SLB_GLOSSARY_SIMILAR_POOL_SIZE=10`,
say). See `Constant`'s own docstring for exactly how that resolves.

Adding a new constant is one line on `Constants`:

```python
class Constants:
    ...
    my_new_constant = Constant(42, env_var="SLB_GLOSSARY_MY_NEW_CONSTANT")
```

class Constant(typing.Generic[T]):
    """
    A descriptor for one named, optionally environment-overridable constant.

    ```python
    class Constants:
        similar_terms_pool_size = Constant(5, env_var="SLB_GLOSSARY_SIMILAR_POOL_SIZE")
        relevance_threshold = Constant(
            0.55,
            env_var="SLB_GLOSSARY_RELEVANCE_THRESHOLD",
            validate=lambda v: 0.0 <= v <= 1.0,
        )
        log_format = Constant("%(levelname)s  %(message)s")  # no env_var: fixed, but still typed/validated
    ```

    With `env_var` given, every access re-reads that environment variable
    (via `slb_glossary.utils.env`, which handles the actual casting/
    validation) and resolves fresh, so changing the environment mid-process
    (tests, a long-running server picking up a config reload, etc.) takes
    effect on the very next access, not just at import time. Pass
    `cache=True` to resolve it once instead, on first access, and hold
    that value for the rest of the process; use this for a constant that's
    read often enough that re-parsing its environment variable every time
    would matter, or one that must stay stable once read (e.g. anything
    used to size a resource at startup and never revisited).

    Without `env_var`, a `Constant` is just `default`, always and `cache`
    has no effect, since there's nothing to re-read from.

        :param default: The constant's built-in value, used whenever `env_var`
            isn't set in the environment (or isn't given at all). Also fixes
            the expected type (and so how an environment string is cast)

            Defaults to `type(default)`. See `slb_glossary.utils.env` for

            subclasses matched by value).
