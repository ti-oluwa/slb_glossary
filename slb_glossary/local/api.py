result whose definition happens to repeat the query outrank one whose
term name actually matches it.

Weighting `term` well above the others still doesn't fully fix this,
since bm25 also rewards a column for how often the query appears in it,
so a term whose definition just says the query word a lot can still
out-score the term actually named that. `scored_search` sidesteps this
with an exact/prefix name-match tier computed directly in SQL, ahead of
bm25 entirely (see its docstring).

    Full-text search the local database for `query`, ranked, scored, best match first.

    Ranking happens entirely in SQL, in two tiers:

    1. An exact (case/whitespace-insensitive) match against `term` scores
       `EXACT_MATCH_SCORE`; `term` starting with `query` scores
       `PREFIX_MATCH_SCORE`. Computed directly against `terms.term`, so
       this tier is never affected by how often `query` happens to appear
       elsewhere.
    2. Everything else is ordered by `bm25()`, weighted toward the `term`
       column (see `FTS_COLUMN_WEIGHTS`), and scored by normalizing that
       result set's own bm25 spread into `(0.0, CONTENT_MATCH_SCORE_CAP]`,
       worst match to best. bm25 isn't comparable across different
       queries, only within one, which is exactly what this needs it for.

    Tier 1 is always ordered ahead of tier 2, so a term named after the
    query is never outranked by an unrelated term whose definition just
    happens to mention it a lot. For example, searching "mud" surfacing
    "Drilling fluid" ahead of "Mud" itself, because "mud" is repeated
    throughout that definition, is the failure mode a purely
    bm25/word-count-driven ranking is prone to. Tier 2's score is also
    capped below `slb_glossary.query.DEFAULT_RELEVANCE_THRESHOLD` (see
    `CONTENT_MATCH_SCORE_CAP`), so a query that only ever matches by
    content, never an actual term name, reads as unconfident by default.
    A real name match should generally be trusted over content overlap alone.

    These are the same tiers and the same `CONTENT_MATCH_SCORE_CAP`
    `slb_glossary.relevance.score_result` uses to score a live result, so a
    local score and a live score mean roughly the same thing.

    Before any of that, `query` is passed through
    `slb_glossary.natural_language.clean_query`, which reduces a
    plain-English question like "what is X" or "define X" down to just
    `X`. Local matching works against actual term names and words, not
    conversational phrasing, so this is what lets a question like "what
    is porosity" find "Porosity" via the exact-match tier, the same as
    searching "porosity" directly would. Unstripped, the extra words
    would usually just make the FTS match come back empty.

    `search` is a thin wrapper around this. Pass `scored=True` to it
    instead if you want results and scores together without a second call.
    Reach for this function directly when you only need the scores. For
    example, `slb_glossary.query.search`'s `Source.AUTO` uses it to decide
    whether the local database's results are good enough to serve alone,
    or worth augmenting with a live search.

    :param db: The local database to search.
    :param query: Free-text query, matched against term, definition, and
        topic, or, for a recognized natural-language phrasing, matched
        against the term-like phrase extracted from it.
    :param topic: Restrict results to this topic, or several
        comma-separated topics (case-insensitive exact match by default).
    :param start_letter: Restrict results to terms starting with this letter.
    :param language: Restrict results to this glossary language edition
        (e.g. `"en"`/`"es"`), matched exactly against each stored result's
        `.language`. `None` (the default) doesn't filter by language.
    :param limit: Maximum number of results to return. `None` for unlimited.
    :param fuzzy: If `True`, tolerate minor misspellings/partial names in
        `topic` by resolving it against locally stored topic names first.
        Has no effect if `topic` is falsy.
