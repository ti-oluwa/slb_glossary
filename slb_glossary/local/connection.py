    """
    Open (creating if needed) the local search database at `path`.

    The database runs in WAL journal mode, which adds
    two sidecar files next to `path` while it's in use: `<path>-wal` and
    `<path>-shm`. **If you move, copy, or back up the database file
    yourself** (outside of `slb_glossary`), move those two alongside it.

    A `.db` file copied on its own while its `-wal` still holds
    unflushed writes is missing data. Move `metadata_path` (or its
    default, `<path>.metadata.json` / `metadata.json`) along with it too;
    it's a separate file and won't follow the `.db` file automatically.

    `flush`/`reset` checkpoint and truncate the WAL file as part of what 
    they do, so a freshly flushed/reset database has little or nothing 
    outstanding in `-wal` to lose. But closing the database first 
    (`close_db`, or exiting a `database(...)` block) is still the simplest 
    way to guarantee a clean, single-file snapshot, since SQLite folds the 
    WAL back into the main file and removes the sidecar files itself once 
    the last connection to it closes.

    :param path: Path to the SQLite database file. Defaults to
        `slb_glossary.paths.default_db_path()` (the OS-appropriate user
        data directory. See `slb_glossary.paths`).
    :param metadata_path: Path to the metadata JSON file. Defaults to
        `slb_glossary.paths.default_metadata_path()` when `path` is also
        left at its default, or `<path stem>.metadata.json` next to a
        custom `path`.
    :return: An open `Database`. Close it with `close_db`, or use the
        `database` context manager instead of calling this function directly.
