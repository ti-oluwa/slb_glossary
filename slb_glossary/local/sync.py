"""
Sync the local database from a live `BrowserSession`.

Call one of these functions as often (or as rarely) as fits your own use of the glossary; see the
responsible-use note on `sync_all` in particular.

Every fetch here writes to the local database incrementally, in batches
(see `batch_size`/`persist_on_error` on each function), via
`slb_glossary.local.upsert_results_incrementally` - rather than collecting
the whole fetch in memory and writing it in one shot at the end - so a
sync interrupted partway through (a browser crash, a killed process, a
flaky network) still keeps whatever it managed to fetch before that point.
