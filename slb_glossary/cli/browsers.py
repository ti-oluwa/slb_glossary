    Browser builds are large (100-400MB) downloads from a single CDN, so on
    a slow or congested connection, the default ~30s-per-request timeout
    patchright/Playwright ships with can trip before a build finishes -
    this shows up as the install just failing partway through with a
    timeout error and nothing installed. `timeout_ms`/`download_host`/`retry`
