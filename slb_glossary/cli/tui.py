def _prefill_schema(command_schema: typing.Any, ctx: click.Context) -> None:
    """
    Overwrite `command_schema`'s option/argument defaults with `ctx.params`.

    trogon builds `command_schema.options`/`.arguments` by walking
    `ctx.command.params` once and splitting each `click.Option` into
    `.options`, each `click.Argument` into `.arguments`, in declaration
    order - see `trogon.introspect.introspect_click_app`. This replays
    that same split to pair each schema entry back up with the click
    `Parameter` (and so the `ctx.params` value) it came from, which
    trogon doesn't expose a mapping for itself, then overwrites the
    schema's default with whatever this run was actually called with -
    so the form trogon builds from `command_schema` opens pre-filled
    instead of blank/click's-own-defaults.

    A param whose resolved value is `None` (an optional option/argument
    that wasn't actually given on this run, e.g. `--topic`/`--source`
    left unset) is prefilled with its click-level default (`param.default`)
    instead, if it has one. For a choice-backed field (rendered as a
    `Select` widget) with no click-level default either, this falls back
    to that field's *first* listed choice rather than leaving it blank:
    programmatically preselecting the command tree node here (below, via
    `tree.select_node(target)`) builds the initial form/command preview
    outside the ordinary interactive flow, and a `Select` left with
    nothing chosen at that point can leak its internal blank-value
    sentinel into the built command line as literal text (e.g.
    `--source Select.NULL`) instead of just omitting the flag. Every
    shared choice-backed option in this CLI (see e.g.
    `slb_glossary.cli.source_options.source_options`'s `--source`) is
    expected to list its safe/no-op default value first for exactly this
    reason. A plain (non-choice) field with no default is left alone -
    those render as a text `Input`, which has no such blank-value pitfall.

    Best-effort otherwise: `ctx.command.params` and `command_schema.options`/
    `.arguments` are expected to zip up one-to-one in order, matching
    trogon's own construction. If a future trogon version changes that,
    this just stops pairing correctly rather than raising - the caller
    wraps this in its own broad `except` regardless, since reaching into
    another package's internals like this can't be made fully future-proof.
