# Install slb-glossary as a standalone CLI tool (`slb-glossary` and its `slb` alias).
#
# Usage:
#   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ti-oluwa/slb-glossary/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
#
# Prefers, in order: an existing `uv`, an existing `pipx`, then installs `uv`
# (via astral.sh's own installer) and uses that. This is a POSIX `sh` script
# for macOS, Linux, and WSL; Windows users without WSL should use uv's native
# PowerShell installer instead (see the README).
#
# Environment variables:
#   SLB_GLOSSARY_VERSION   Install a specific version, e.g. "0.2.0" (default: latest)
#   SLB_GLOSSARY_INSTALLER Force "uv" or "pipx" instead of auto-detecting
