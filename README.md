## Highlights

- **Pure async.** Every glossary lookup is an `async` function; nothing blocks the event loop.
- **Lazy by default.** Search functions are async generators - they `yield` results as they're found instead of building a list up front, so you can `break` out early without paying for work you don't need.
- **No browser install headaches.** Built on [patchright](https://pypi.org/project/patchright/), a stealth-patched Chromium automation driver, plus [playwright-stealth](https://pypi.org/project/playwright-stealth/) for extra fingerprint hardening. No manual driver management, no separate browser-driver toolchain to babysit. Chromium, Firefox and WebKit are all supported.
- **An optional local cache.** `slb_glossary.local` keeps a SQLite (FTS5) copy of terms you've already looked up, complete with fuzzy topic matching and an optional bring-your-own-embedding vector store, so repeat lookups don't need the browser at all.
- **One API for local, live, or both.** `slb_glossary.query` reads local-first and falls back to the live site only when needed, optionally caching whatever it fetches live for next time - or pin it to `local`-only or `live`-only when you know which you want.
- **File-based configuration.** Browser-session, local-database, and output defaults live in one JSON/TOML/YAML file, editable by hand, via `slb-glossary config set`, or through a guided wizard.
- **Mostly a functional API.** There's no `Glossary` object to construct, subclass, or configure. Open a session, get back a plain `BrowserSession` value, and pass it to whichever function you need - most of what you'll call is a free function, not a method on some stateful object.
- **A full-featured CLI.** Every capability above - search, local caching, config, sync - is also a `slb-glossary` subcommand, with `--save`/`--json` output, an interactive TUI, and shell-friendly exit codes.
- **A `store` package that stands on its own.** Saving results to CSV/JSON/TXT/XLSX lives in a separate package that only cares about ["things shaped like" a `SearchResult`](#saving-results-to-a-file-slb_glossarystore) - it has no idea the glossary or a browser even exists, so you can reuse it to save any of your own record types too.
- **Configurable retries.** Flaky page loads are retried with a pluggable backoff policy - constant, linear, exponential or logarithmic.
- **Reasonably complete on the API front.** Nearly everything the CLI can do, the library can do too - search, caching, config, sync, saving to a file - so you're not stuck shelling out just to get at a feature.

## Installation

### As a library

This project uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency management.

```bash
uv add slb-glossary
```

Or with pip:

```bash
pip install slb-glossary
```

Then install the browser build patchright drives (a one-time step):

```bash
patchright install chromium
```

Optional extras, installed as needed:

| Extra   | Unlocks                                                              | Install                          |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `xlsx`  | Saving results as `.xlsx`, and importing `.xlsx`/`.xlsm` into the local database. | `uv add "slb-glossary[xlsx]"`      |
| `config`| TOML/YAML config files (`config.toml`/`.yaml`). JSON always works with no extra. | `uv add "slb-glossary[config]"`    |
| `tui`   | The interactive `--tui` mode for every CLI command.                   | `uv add "slb-glossary[tui]"`       |
| `all`   | Every extra above.                                                     | `uv add "slb-glossary[all]"`       |

### As a CLI tool

`click` is a core dependency, so installing `slb-glossary` by any of the methods below gets you two equivalent commands, `slb-glossary` and the shorter `slb`, with no extra flags needed.

With [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (recommended - installs into an isolated tool environment):

```bash
uv tool install "slb-glossary[all]"
```

Or try it once without installing anything, via [`uvx`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/):

```bash
uvx slb-glossary search porosity
```

With [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/):

```bash
pipx install "slb-glossary[all]"
```

Or, on macOS/Linux (including WSL), with a one-line installer that picks `uv` or `pipx` for you, installing `uv` first if neither is already on your machine:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ti-oluwa/slb-glossary/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

On Windows, without WSL, use uv's native installer instead, then `uv tool install`:

```powershell
powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex; uv tool install slb-glossary"
```

Whichever method you use, finish with the one-time browser install - `sync` does this for you too, see below:

```bash
slb-glossary install
```

## Quick start

### Library

```python
import asyncio
import slb_glossary as slb


async def main() -> None:
    async with slb.session() as session:
        async for result in slb.live.search(session, "porosity"):
            print(result.term, "-", result.definition)


asyncio.run(main())
```

Caching what you look up locally, then reading it back without a browser, is a few lines more:

```python
import asyncio
import slb_glossary as slb


async def main() -> None:
    async with slb.local.database() as db, slb.session() as session:
        # Local first; only opens a live page if the local DB has nothing.
        # persist=True writes whatever came back live into `db`.
        async for result in slb.query.search("water saturation", db=db, session=session, persist=True):
            print(result.term, "-", result.definition)

        # A repeat call for the same query is now served from `db` alone.
        async for result in slb.query.search("water saturation", db=db, source=slb.query.Source.LOCAL):
            print("(cached)", result.term)


asyncio.run(main())
```

### Command line

```bash
slb search porosity
slb terms Geophysics --limit 20
slb define "black oil" --local
slb random --topic Drilling
slb local search viscosity --topic Petrophysic --fuzzy
```

See [Command-line interface](#command-line-interface) for the full command reference.

## Core concepts

### `BrowserSession`: one session, many searches

`slb_glossary` has no `Glossary` class. Instead, `open_session` (or the `session` context manager) launches a browser and loads the glossary's topic list once, returning a `BrowserSession` - a plain dataclass holding the live browser session and that metadata. Every live search function takes this session as its first argument.

```python
session = await slb.open_session(language=slb.Language.ENGLISH)
try:
    ...
finally:
    await slb.close_session(session)
```

Prefer `session` for anything but long-lived services; it guarantees the browser is closed even if your code raises:

```python
async with slb.session(headless=True) as session:
    ...
```

`open_session` accepts:

| Parameter          | Default              | Description                                                                                     |
| ------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `language`           | `Language.ENGLISH`     | Glossary edition to search (`Language.ENGLISH` or `Language.SPANISH`).                              |
| `browser_type`       | `"chromium"`           | Playwright browser family to launch: `"chromium"`, `"firefox"` or `"webkit"`.                       |
| `headless`           | `True`                 | Run without a visible browser window.                                                               |
| `block`              | `True`                 | Resource types to drop for speed. `True` blocks images/media/fonts, `False` blocks nothing, or pass your own iterable, e.g. `{"image", "stylesheet"}`. |
| `timeout`            | `60_000`               | Milliseconds to wait for page loads and element lookups.                                            |
| `terms_per_tab`      | `12`                   | Results per page, as returned by the glossary site. Rarely needs changing.                          |
| `retry`              | `RetryPolicy()`        | Retry policy for the initial topic load, reused by search functions. See [Retries and backoff](#retries-and-backoff). |
| `settle_timeout`     | `8.0`                  | Seconds to wait for results to update after a search filter changes (the site updates via JS, not a full page load). |
| `poll_interval`      | `0.3`                  | Seconds between polls while waiting on `settle_timeout`.                                            |
| `executable_path`    | `None`                 | Path to a specific browser build, if not using patchright's own install.                            |
| `proxy`              | `None`                 | Playwright-style proxy settings, e.g. `{"server": "http://myproxy:3128"}`.                          |
| `viewport`           | `None`                 | Browser viewport size, e.g. `{"width": 1920, "height": 1080}`.                                      |
| `use_stealth`        | `True`                 | Apply Playwright stealth patches to the browser context.                                            |

`session.topics` is a `dict` of topic name to term count, and `session.size` is the glossary's total term count - both fetched once, on open. Call `slb.refresh_topics(session)` to reload them later.

You can also open a session straight from a [`Config`](#configuration-slb_glossaryconfig):

```python
async with slb.session_from_config("~/.config/slb-glossary/config.toml") as session:
    ...
```

### Retries and backoff

Page loads that briefly render before the glossary's JavaScript widget finishes populating are retried using a `RetryPolicy`:

```python
policy = slb.RetryPolicy.exponential(base_delay=0.5, attempts=5, max_delay=8.0)
async with slb.session(retry=policy) as session:
    ...
```

Four strategies are available, each with a constructor shortcut: `RetryPolicy.constant()`, `.linear()`, `.exponential()` (the default) and `.logarithmic()`. All accept `attempts`, `base_delay`, `factor`, `max_delay` and `jitter` (randomizes each delay by +/-50% to avoid retry storms; on by default).

### `SearchResult`

Every result, from the live site or the local database, is a `typing.NamedTuple`:

```python
class SearchResult(typing.NamedTuple):
    term: str
    definition: str | None
    grammatical_label: str | None
    topic: str | None
    url: str | None
    image: str | None = None
    image_caption: str | None = None
    related: tuple[RelatedTerm, ...] | None = None
```

It's a plain `NamedTuple` underneath, so `result._asdict()`, `result._replace(...)`, indexing, and unpacking all work as you'd expect. It also adds `result.fields` and `result.asdict()` - the shape [`slb_glossary.store`](#saving-results-to-a-file-slb_glossarystore) and the CLI's output actually use - so you rarely need to reach for the underscore-prefixed versions yourself. `related` holds `RelatedTerm(term, url)` pairs parsed from a definition's "See related terms" list, when present.

### Live search: `slb_glossary.live`

`slb_glossary.live` talks only to the live site and never touches the local database. All of its functions are **async generators**: iterate them with `async for`, and nothing more is fetched than you actually consume.

```python
# Search the whole glossary for a query
async for result in slb.live.search(session, "gas lift", limit=5):
    ...

# Search within one or more topics (comma-separated)
async for result in slb.live.search(session, "flow", topic="Well completions,Production"):
    ...

# Every term filed under a topic - one result per term
async for result in slb.live.get_terms_on(session, topic="Directional drilling"):
    ...

# Just the term detail URLs, if that's all you need
async for url in slb.live.get_terms_urls(session, query="porosity"):
    ...

# Fetch every definition on one term detail page directly
async for result in slb.live.get_results_from_url(session, url):
    ...
```

`limit` bounds the number of *terms* looked up, not the number of results yielded - a term can carry more than one definition (one per topic it's filed under), so `search(..., limit=3)` can yield more than three `SearchResult`s. Pass `limit=None` to fetch every match.

Topic names don't need to be exact: `get_topic_match` resolves whatever you pass to the closest topic in `session.topics` (case-insensitive, typo-tolerant), and every `live` function that takes a `topic` uses it internally. Call it yourself to see what a topic will resolve to before searching:

```python
slb.get_topic_match(session.topics, "drill")
# "Drilling"
```

`live.get_results_from_url`/`live.get_terms_on`/`live.search` all support a `concurrency` argument for fetching several term detail pages in parallel, opening extra pages on the same browser context. Keep this modest - it's still one glossary site being asked for more at once.

## The local database: `slb_glossary.local`

`slb_glossary.local` is a SQLite (FTS5) cache of glossary terms, plus an optional custom embedding vector store, so repeat lookups don't have to keep re-visiting the live site.

> [!NOTE]
> The data stored locally is still SLB's - see [Attribution and disclaimer](#attribution-and-disclaimer). Enabling this module means keeping a local copy of glossary content on your own machine; you're solely responsible for that copy's lifecycle (how long you keep it, how often you refresh it, and deleting it when you're done) in compliance with SLB's terms of use.

Open a database with `database` (an `async with` context manager) or `open_db`/`close_db` directly:

```python
async with slb.local.database() as db:
    ...
```

With no path given, it opens at the OS-appropriate user data directory (see `slb_glossary.paths`, or `slb-glossary local path` on the CLI); override it with a path, the `SLB_GLOSSARY_DATA_DIR` environment variable, or `Config.local.data_dir`.

### Filling the local database

Sync functions in `slb_glossary.local.sync` pull from a live `BrowserSession` into a `Database`, from cheapest to most expensive:

```python
await slb.local.sync_topics(db, session)  # just the topic list/counts
await slb.local.sync_query(db, session, "porosity")  # one query's results
await slb.local.sync_topic(db, session, "Drilling")  # every term under a topic
await slb.local.sync_letter(db, session, "p")  # every term starting with "p"
await slb.local.sync_all(db, session, concurrency=3)  # the entire glossary
```

Prefer `sync_query`/`sync_topic`/`sync_letter` over `sync_all` where you can - fetching only what you actually look up keeps this package's footprint on the live site as light as possible. Each returns a `SyncSummary` (`terms_written`, `total_terms`, `topics`, `synced_at`), and updates `metadata.json` alongside the database.

### Querying the local database

`slb_glossary.local`'s query functions mirror the shapes `slb_glossary.live`'s functions return, so code written against one mostly works against the other:

```python
async for result in slb.local.search(db, "porosity", limit=10):
    ...

async for result in slb.local.get_terms_on(db, "Drilling"):
    ...

result = await slb.local.get_term(db, "porosity")  # exact name or URL
pick = await slb.local.get_random_term(db, topic="Drilling")
topics = await slb.local.get_topics(db)  # {topic: term_count}
total = await slb.local.count(db)
```

`flush(db)` deletes every stored term (keeping sync history); `reset(db)` also forgets the sync history.

### Fuzzy topic matching

Topic filters (`search`, `get_terms_on`, `get_random_term`, `get_terms_urls`) match locally stored topic names exactly, case-insensitively, by default - the local database doesn't have access to the live site's full topic list to fuzzy-match against automatically. Pass `fuzzy=True` to tolerate minor misspellings or partial names instead, resolved against whatever topics are actually present locally:

```python
async for result in slb.local.get_terms_on(db, "Petrophysic", fuzzy=True):
    ...  # resolves to "Petrophysics" if that's what's stored locally

slb.local.fuzzy_match_topics(await slb.local.get_topics(db), "Drillng,Geolog")
# "Drilling,Geology"
```

On the CLI, this is `slb-glossary local search --topic Petrophysic --fuzzy`.

### Importing your own data

`load_file` imports a CSV, JSON, or `.xlsx`/`.xlsm` file (the last needs the `xlsx` extra) into the local database, with configurable column/field names:

```python
await slb.local.load_file(
    db,
    "my_terms.csv",
    term_field="Term",
    definition_field="Definition",
    embedding_field="Embedding",  # optional - see below
)
```

Rows need at least a term name; every other field is optional. A row with no URL gets a stable synthetic `local://imported/<slug>` one, since `url` is the database's primary key.

### Bring-your-own-embedding vector search

`slb_glossary.local` doesn't bundle an embedding model - that would drag in a heavy ML dependency most callers won't use. Instead, `slb_glossary.local.vectors` stores whatever embedding vector you've already computed and ranks stored vectors by cosine similarity against a query vector you supply:

```python
await slb.local.upsert_vector(db, result.url, my_embedding, model="text-embedding-3-small")

matches = await slb.local.vector_search(
    db, my_query_embedding, model="text-embedding-3-small", limit=5
)
for result, similarity in matches:
    print(f"{similarity:.3f}", result.term)
```

This is a brute-force scan, fine for a glossary-sized dataset but not built for million-row corpora.

## Source-aware queries: `slb_glossary.query`

`slb_glossary.local` only ever reads the local database, and `slb_glossary.live` only ever talks to the live site. `slb_glossary.query` is the layer that picks between (or combines) the two, so you don't have to hand-roll the "check local, fall back live, maybe cache what came back" dance yourself:

```python
async with slb.local.database() as db, slb.session() as session:
    async for result in slb.query.search("water saturation", db=db, session=session, persist=True):
        print(result.term, "-", result.definition)
```

At least one of `db` or `session` must be given to every function here - there's nothing to query otherwise. Which is actually used (and in what order) is controlled by `source`, a `query.Source`:

| `Source`       | Behavior                                                                                     |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `LOCAL`          | The local database only. Never touches the network. Requires `db`.                              |
| `LIVE`           | The live glossary only. Never touches the local database. Requires `session`.                   |
| `AUTO`    | (Default when both `db` and `session` are given.) Try `db` first; only fall back to `session` if the local database has nothing. Pass `persist=True` to cache whatever came back live. |

When only one of `db`/`session` is given, `AUTO` simply behaves like whichever of `LOCAL`/`LIVE` that one supports. The available functions mirror `slb_glossary.live`/`slb_glossary.local`'s own shapes: `search`, `get_terms_on`, `get_terms_urls`, and `get_topics` stream/return several results; `get_term`, `related_terms`, and `get_random_term` return one; `compare` looks up several terms at once. Each accepts a `fuzzy=True` flag that, for any local read, tolerates minor misspellings/partial names in `topic` (see [Fuzzy topic matching](#fuzzy-topic-matching) - live reads already fuzzy-match topics unconditionally).

`get_term`, `related_terms`, and `get_random_term` return a `TermLookup(value, source, persisted)`, so callers can tell where a result actually came from and whether it was written back to `db`.

## Configuration: `slb_glossary.config`

`slb_glossary.config.Config` is a dataclass, loadable from and savable to a JSON, TOML, or YAML file (TOML/YAML need the `config` extra):

```python
config = slb.Config.load()  # default path if it exists, else built-in defaults
async with slb.session_from_config(config) as session:
    ...
```

It has three sections:

| Section    | Covers                                                                                   |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `session`    | Every `open_session` parameter - language, browser type, timeouts, retry policy, and more.  |
| `local`      | Whether local-database fallback is on by default, where it lives, and staleness thresholds. |
| `output`     | Default `--save` format and which result columns are shown by default.                      |

Read or write a single dotted key without touching the rest of the file:

```python
config.get("session.headless")
config.set("session.headless", False)  # accepts strings too, coerced to the field's type
config.to_file("~/.config/slb-glossary/config.toml")
```

On the CLI, `slb-glossary config` opens a guided, section-by-section wizard; `config show`/`get`/`set`/`init`/`edit`/`path` cover everything else non-interactively. The default path is the OS-appropriate user config directory (`slb-glossary config path`, or override with the `SLB_GLOSSARY_CONFIG_DIR` environment variable); pass `--config PATH` (or `--config none` to skip it) to any other command to use a different one for that run only.

## Saving results to a file: `slb_glossary.store`

`slb_glossary.store` is a self-contained package with no dependency on the rest of `slb_glossary` - it doesn't know a browser or a glossary exists. `save` works with anything that satisfies `RecordLike`: a `.fields` property and an `.asdict()` method (`SearchResult` already has both - see [`SearchResult`](#searchresult)). That's it, so it happily saves `SearchResult`s, your own records, or the async generators the search functions return directly, without you collecting them first:

```python
results = slb.live.search(session, "gas lift")
await slb.store.save(results, "gas_lift.json")  # collects the generator for you
```

The file format is chosen from the destination's extension, or pass `format=` explicitly:

```python
await slb.store.save(results_list, "results.data", format="csv")
```

Built-in formats: `csv`, `json`, `jsonl`/`ndjson`, `txt`, and `xlsx` (requires the `xlsx` extra). Check what's available with `slb.store.supported_formats()`.

Add support for a new format with the `writer` decorator - no subclassing required:

```python
import pathlib

from slb_glossary.store import RecordLike  # just a type hint, so a direct import is fine here


@slb.store.writer("yaml")
async def write_yaml(records: list[RecordLike], destination: pathlib.Path) -> None:
    import yaml

    with open(destination, "w") as file:
        yaml.dump([record.asdict() for record in records], file)


await slb.store.save(results_list, "results.yaml")
```

Prefer a plain function call over a decorator? `slb.store.register_writer("yaml", write_yaml)` does the same thing.

## Command-line interface

Installing `slb-glossary` (see [As a CLI tool](#as-a-cli-tool) above) gets you the `slb-glossary` command, and the shorter `slb` alias for it:

```bash
slb search porosity
slb terms Geophysics --limit 20
slb topics list
slb urls fetch "https://glossary.slb.com/en/terms/p/porosity"
```

Run `slb --help`, or `--help` after any subcommand, for the full set of options - or pass `--tui` to fill them in interactively instead of memorizing flags. `--log-level` on the root command controls `slb_glossary`'s own log verbosity (see [Logging](#logging)).

Every command in the "Local, live, or auto" rows is built on `slb_glossary.query`, so they all take the same `--local`/`--live`/`--auto` trio described below. `topics refresh` and `urls fetch` are the two holdouts that stay live-only by design: a "refresh" is explicitly asking for a fresh copy from the site, and fetching one specific URL doesn't have a meaningful local equivalent. `local search`/`local get` read the cached copy exclusively, with no live fallback at all - reach for those when you want a hard guarantee that nothing will touch the network.

### Choosing a source: `--local` / `--live` / `--auto`

`search`, `terms`, `urls list`, `topics list`, `define`, `related`, `compare`, and `random` all accept:

```bash
slb define porosity --local           # local database only, error if disabled/missing
slb define porosity --live --cache    # live site only; --cache saves the result locally
slb define porosity --auto            # local first, live as a fallback (the default)
slb define porosity --source live     # equivalent, spelled out
```

`--db-path PATH` overrides the local database file for that run (see `local path`/`Config.local`). With `--auto` (the default), a local hit never launches a browser at all - so a search you've already cached comes back instantly, and only a genuine cache miss pays for opening a page.

### Saving and formatting output

Every command that prints results also supports `--save PATH` (repeatable, for saving to several files/formats at once), `--format FORMAT` to override the format `PATH`'s extension implies, and `--json` to print results as a JSON array to stdout instead of a table - handy for piping into `jq` or another program:

```bash
slb search "drilling fluid" --json | jq '.[].term'
slb terms Drilling --save drilling_terms.json --quiet
```

`--quiet` suppresses console output entirely (useful with `--save`); `--show-related`/`--hide-related`, `--show-image`/`--hide-image`, and similar flags toggle individual result columns where relevant.

### The interactive TUI

Pass `--tui` to the root command, or after any subcommand, to fill in its options through a form instead of memorizing flags (requires the `tui` extra):

```bash
slb --tui                # browse and run any command
slb search --tui          # fill in `search`'s options interactively
```

## Logging

`slb_glossary` logs through the standard `logging` module under the `slb_glossary` logger and attaches a `NullHandler` by default, so it stays silent until you configure logging yourself:

```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logging.getLogger("slb_glossary").setLevel(logging.DEBUG)  # verbose, per-page detail
```

`INFO` covers session open/close, search start/end, and sync summaries; `DEBUG` covers individual page loads, retries, and parsed counts; `WARNING` covers unmatched topics and exhausted retries. The CLI's own `--log-level` flag sets this for you.

## Performance notes

- Image, font and media requests are blocked at the network layer by default (`block=True`) - the glossary is a JavaScript app, so scripts and stylesheets are always loaded, but nothing else needs to be.
- Page data (topic lists, result links, definition text) is read with single `evaluate`-style JavaScript calls rather than one round-trip per DOM element.
- Because live search is lazy, `async for result in live.search(session, "x"): break` after the first result does the minimum work needed to produce it.
- Reuse one `BrowserSession` for every live search you need instead of opening a new one per query - most of the cost of a session is the one-time browser launch and topic fetch.
- A `BrowserSession` drives a single browser page and isn't safe to share across concurrent coroutines. For parallel searches, open one session per concurrent task, or use a function's `concurrency` argument to open extra pages on the same session.
- A local-database read never launches a browser; `slb_glossary.query`'s `Source.AUTO` (the CLI's `--auto`, the default) takes advantage of this by trying the local database first. On the CLI, this means `slb search "gas lift"` costs nothing beyond an SQLite read on a repeat run, and only touches the network the first time.
- `--concurrency` (on `search`/`terms`, and the equivalent `concurrency=` argument in the library) fetches several term detail pages in parallel on a live search - useful for a first-time sync of a large query, but keep it modest, since it's still one site being asked for more work at once.
- `slb-glossary local sync`/`update` (or their `slb_glossary.local.sync` counterparts) let you build up the local cache ahead of time, in one batch, so day-to-day lookups afterward stay entirely local.

## Exceptions

- `slb_glossary.NetworkError` - the glossary site could not be reached.
- `slb_glossary.BrowserError` - the browser failed to launch or crashed outside of a network issue, including an unsupported `browser_type`.
- `slb_glossary.ParsingError` - reserved for glossary pages that don't match the markup the parser expects.
- `slb_glossary.ConfigError` - a config file or dotted key (`Config.get`/`Config.set`) was invalid.
- `slb_glossary.DatabaseError` - the local database failed to open, query, or import from a file.
- `slb_glossary.QueryError` - `slb_glossary.query` can't satisfy a lookup with the source(s) it was given (e.g. `Source.LOCAL` with no `db`).
- `slb_glossary.LoggingError` - a custom `log_sink` (see [Logging](#logging)) couldn't be set up.
- `slb_glossary.store.UnsupportedFormatError` - `save` was asked for a format with no registered writer.
- `slb_glossary.store.WriterError` - the registered writer raised while writing, e.g. a permissions error or a full disk. The original exception is chained as `__cause__`.
